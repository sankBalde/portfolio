# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document outlines the deployment process for bjornmelin-platform-io.

## Infrastructure Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS credentials configured
- AWS CDK CLI installed
- Node.js and Yarn

### CDK Deployment Process

1. Navigate to infrastructure directory:

```bash
cd infrastructure
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Build the CDK app:

```bash
yarn build
```

4. Review infrastructure changes:

```bash
cdk diff
```

5. Deploy all stacks:

```bash
cdk deploy --all
```

Or deploy specific stacks:

```bash
cdk deploy EmailStack DnsStack
```

## Next.js Application Deployment

### Production Build

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Build the application:

```bash
yarn build
```

3. Start production server:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set:

- AWS credentials
- API endpoints
- Other configuration values

## Deployment Environments

### Development

- Used for testing and development
- Deployed manually through CDK
- Separate AWS resources

### Production

- Live environment
- Deployed through CDK
- Production-grade resources
- Enhanced monitoring

## Monitoring

### CloudWatch Metrics

- Application performance
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

### Logging

- Application logs
- Infrastructure logs
- Access logs

## Rollback Procedures

If issues are detected:

1. Identify the problem
2. Review CloudWatch logs
3. Revert infrastructure:

```bash
cdk deploy --all --previous-version
```

## Security Considerations

- Environment variable management
- AWS IAM roles and policies
- Resource access controls
- Encryption at rest and in transit

## Best Practices

1. Always review `cdk diff` before deployment
2. Test changes in development first
3. Monitor deployment logs
4. Maintain documentation
5. Regular security updates

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Permission Issues

- Verify AWS credentials
- Check IAM roles
- Review resource policies

### Deployment Failures

- Check CloudWatch logs
- Verify environment variables
- Review stack events

### Performance Issues

- Monitor CloudWatch metrics
- Check resource utilization
- Review application logs
